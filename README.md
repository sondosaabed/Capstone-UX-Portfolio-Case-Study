# Capstone-UX-Portfolio-Case-Study

  Throughout this program, I followed a user-centered design process starting with defining the problem, conducting user research, analyzing data, and iterating through prototypes. I used tools like Google Forms for data collection, Miro for affinity mapping and feature synthesis, and Python for data cleaning and analysis. These insights shaped the design direction, which I developed in low and high-fidelity prototypes using Figma. I also used Lookback for usability testing, Zeplin for design handoff, and accessibility tools to enhance inclusivity. My experience in academic research and data analysis helped me stay structured and analytical in decision-making.

  One of the most critical insights was that users struggled with the original layout of the product selection step, it caused delays and confusion. As a result, I redesigned the flow and added clearer visual cues, which led to a 100% task completion rate and a noticeable decrease in time on task. A key challenge was balancing user preferences with technical feasibility. By continuously testing and iterating, I delivered a solution that met the goals of usability and accessibility. The design not only improved user satisfaction but also created a smoother handoff for development, aligning both user and business needs.
